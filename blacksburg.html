              <h1 style="font-size: 1em; color: grey">There are a ton of great restaurants in Blacksburg. I am going to go over a couple that I have been to, this is by no means a comprehensive list and all of this is my opinion.</h1>
              <h1 style="font-size: 1em; color: grey">
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <h1 style="font-size: 20px;">Macado's:</h1> This is one of my favorite places to go. The food is pretty good, not the best, but it is very good for the price. Another good perk about Macado's is that there are a lot of options. They have sandwiches, pasta, wings, wraps, appetizers, deserts, and much more. My only complaint is that is you go there later (past 9pm), the services is pretty slow. If you can't decide what you want to eat and also don't want to spend that much, this is the place to go.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h1 style="font-size: 20px;">DP Dough:</h1> This is another great, cheap restaurant. Except DP Dough specializes in one thing, calzones. They have a bunch of fillings you can put in the calzone and they also have daily calzones that are only $6. They are also open very late, until 3am. If you are up late and want some cheap, good food, this is the place to go.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h1 style="font-size: 20px;">Benny's:</h1> I'm sure, even if you are a freshman, you have heard of Benny's. If you haven't, Benny's is a pizza place that serves huge slices of pizza. It is pretty cheap, $5 a slice, but again, the slices are massive. You can also get a whole pie, but they are 28 inches in diameter. The pizza is very good and I would highly recommend it.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h1 style="font-size: 20px;">PK's Bar and Grill:</h1> PK's is obviously a bar, you can still go if you are under 21, but you have to show an ID, and they will mark your hand with an "X" if you are under 21, so you can't get alcohol. Most of the food is okay, but the pizza is very good. This is a bar, so it will get pretty busy at night and on the weekends, so if you are just going for food, try and avoid those times.
                  </li>

                    <h1 style="font-size: 20px;">Hiking:</h1>There are a ton of great hiking spots around Blacksburg. A lot of my friends love to go on hikes and say that they are very fun and the scenery is great. Here are a few of the nices spots around Blacksburg: Devil's Marble Yard, Dragon's Tooth, McAfee's Knob, Angel's Rest, Bald Knob, and many more (Hiking).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h1 style="font-size: 20px;">Disc Golf:</h1>Disc golf is kind of like hiking, except you get to throw discs at metal baskets while you hike. I am a huge fan of disc golf, and luckily, there are a couple decent courses areound here: Virginia Tech CRC, Goldens Hills (2 courses in 1!), Direwolf (invite only), and there are a couple courses a bit further out. If you are a big disc golf fan, you might know that the 2019 US Disc Golf Champion, James Conrad, is from Blacksburg!

                  <li>
                    <h1 style="font-size: 20px;">Moss Arts Center:</h1>There is always something going on at Moss Arts Center. Plays, Concerts, Speeches, and much more. A lot of times the events are free for students. This is a great option if you live on campus as it is a pretty short walk from any of the dorms.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h1 style="font-size: 20px;">Football and Other Sports:</h1>I can't have a list of things to do in Blacksburg without including sports. Obviously there is football, but there is a bunch of other sports you can go watch. Everything from the Basketball team to some of the more popular Rec sports.
