        <h1 align="left" style="font-size: 1em; color: grey">Lee Hall is certainly a residence hall. The rooms are cramped, it's always warm and stuffy, and the bathrooms are not great. This was my dorm for the first year on campus. As you can tell from my opening sentence, I didn't have the greatest time. Here are the cons: showers were lukewarm most of the time, no AC, heat was always on, and no more than 2 of the 4 elevators worked at a time. I lived on the seventh floor so the elevator situation was pretty annoying. Here are the pros: you have a neat lab on the second floor, there is laundry in the building, and you are pretty close to almost all the dining halls. </h1>

        <h1 align="left" style="font-size: 1em; color: grey">"Pritchard's lounge is pretty good. There is a pretty decently sized kitched on the 4th floor, and most importantly it is very close to DX." (Whelan) Brent's experience was a little different from most other students as he had a corner room which was 1.5 time the size of the normal rooms. He said the rooms are pretty nice, but not the best.</h1>

        <h1 align="left" style="font-size: 1.25em">Reviewed by: Jimmy Wallace</h1>
        <h1 align="left" style="font-size: 1em; color: grey">New Hall West is the best dorm on campus. I stayed there for the second year on campus. Compared to the cramped rooms of Lee, we had a larger room, with our own bathroom, which is a major plus. The cons for the this dorms are: far from almost everything (except West End), you don't really meet anyone. The pros are: you get your own bathroom, you have a laundry room, there is AC. All these things combined make this my favorite dorm on campus.</h1>

        <h1 align="left" style="font-size: 1em; color: grey">"Slusher is very warn down, and I am pretty sure there are jail cells more newly renovated than the rooms. There is one positive, it fosters a nice community due to a group hatred of the building" (Lenges) Slusher is obviously no the most liked dorm, but it is certianly better than a some others, such as Miles and Barringer.</h1>

        <h1 align="left" style="font-size: 1em; color: grey">"The rooms are crappy, people blast music, someone took a dump in the sink, and the showers don't work" (Ruban) Misha obviously did not like his time at Barringer, this is one of the all men dorms and does not have the best reputation. Based on Misha's account and the accounts of other people I have talked to, I would avoid this dorm if you can.</h1>
