Burger '37 features gourmet signature burgers, hand cut fries, and shakes.  Burgers include fresh ground beef, turkey, and a house made gluten-free, beans and rice veggie burger.  The burgers range from plain and simple to signature made-to-order burgers with a variety of toppings.  Guests can even customize their burgers to their own liking.  The fries are hand-cut, brined overnight, air dried and fried to create the Burger '37 fry.  Vanilla bean ice cream is used to create the diner style milkshakes. They come in several flavors, from chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry to signatures like peanut butter banana, brownie, and salted caramel.</td>
