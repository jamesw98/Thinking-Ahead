          <h1 style="font-size: 1em; color: grey">Course requests are exactly what they sound like, you are requesting the courses you want to take for the next semester. The part that a lot of people find confusing is how to find what classes are offered next semester. To find that you would need to look at the <a href="https://banweb.banner.vt.edu/ssb/prod/HZSKVTSC.P_DispRequest" target="_blank">Timetable of Classes</a>.</h1>
          <h1 style="font-size: 1em; color: grey">Through the Timetable of Classes you can search the courses you want to take and find their CRN (a 5 digit number). This is what you will enter to the course request form. You can enter up to 10 CRNs to request. Although, taking more than 19 credit hours will require permission from your adviser.</h1>
          <h1 style="font-size: 1em; color: grey">This being said, you are not guarenteed to get the classes you request. Course requests will normally open about halfway through the semester, either around mid October for the Fall, or around spring break for Spring.</h1>

Adding will stop around the second or third week of class, but dropping will continue for a couple more weeks after that.</h1>

          <h1 style="font-size: 1em; color: grey">CLE's are courses that every student has to take. A lot of students get them out of the way in high school by taking AP classes, but if you didn't take a bunch of AP classes, here are some decent ones to take:</h1>
          <h1 style="font-size: 1em; color: grey">
            <ul>
              <li>
                <h1 style="font-size: 20px;">World Regions (Geog 1014):</h1> This is probably the most popular CLE at Tech. The professor makes the class fun and intersting. The course is online and doesn't take a lot of effort to get a good grade.
              </li>
              <li>
                <h1 style="font-size: 20px;">Music Appreciation (Mus 1104):</h1> This is probably the easiest CLE at Tech. I have not taken it, but multiple people I have talked to that have taken it say that you can get it done in a month. This is an online course. This course is pretty hard to get into unless you course request it early.
              </li>
              <li>
                <h1 style="font-size: 20px;">Intro to Cinema (Cine 2054):</h1> This is another course I haven't take, but have heard good things about. Accoring to some of my friends, if you go to class and actually watch the movies, it is an easy A and pretty interesting.
              </li>
              <li>
                <h1 style="font-size: 20px;">Intro Science Fiction (Engl 1654):</h1> I did take this course, and I thought it was really fun and intersting, if you are up to some reading. Every other week or so you would read a new Sci-Fi book, it was very fun. There were no exams, only weekly quizes (that were pretty easy). This course is offered online or in person.
              </li>

      <tr>
        <td align="left">
          <h1 style="font-size: 1em; color: grey">Knowing which classes to take is obviously dependant on your major. A good resource that all majors should have is the major's checksheet. <a href="https://www.registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/checksheets.html" target="_blank">Click Here to Find Your Major's Checksheet</a></h1>
          <h1 style="font-size: 1em; color: grey">The checksheet isn't set in stone, but more of a guideline, if you plan on graduating on time. Another great resource that will have answers to all your questions, is your adviser. They will be able to help you with questions that aren't answered on the checksheet or that you can't find online.</h1>
          <h1 style="font-size: 1em; color: grey">Knowing which professors are good is a little more difficult. The best way I have found to figure out if a professor is good or not is by using websites like <a href="https://www.koofers.com/virginia-tech-vt/professors" target="_blank">Koofers</a> and <a href="https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/campusRatings.jsp?sid=1349" target="_blank">Rate My Professor</a>.</h1>
          <h1 style="font-size: 1em; color: grey">Koofers is also helpful to find out difficulty of classes and average letter graders per class.</h1>
