            <li class="indent">There is no RA telling you can and can't do</li>

            Privacy
            <li class="indent">Depending on where you decide to live, you will have a room and most likely a bathroom to yourself</li>

          </li>
          <li>
            More space
            <li class="indent">With an apartment, you are going to have signicantly more room to store your personal belongings</li>

            Less freedom
            <li class="indent">All dorms have RA's, this means you won't be able to do certain things that you might want to do</li>
            <li class="indent">Most on-campus students don't have cars, so you will be limited to where the busses can take you for going places in your freetime</li>
          </li>
          <li>
            Small rooms and sharing space

            <li class="indent">You will also have to share a bathroom with at least one other person, and most likey share it with a lot of people</li>

            Annoying neighbors

            <li class="indent">Living off-campus obviously means you are off campus</li>
            <li class="indent">You either have to walk, ride the bus, or drive to campus now</li>
            <li class="indent">This also means you are probably going to rely less on dining halls for your meals</li>
          </li>
          <li>
            Less reliable services
            <li class="indent">Depending on where you decide to live, the internet is going to be slower than the dorm internet</li>

            More expensive (sometimes)
            <li class="indent">Again, depening on where you decide to live, it could be more expensive than living in a dorm, especially if you decide to live on your own</li>
            <li class="indent">If you don't cook, you are still going to pay a lot for food</li>
